## CH:2 - Lesson 3

Install SQLC:

You need to install SQLC using the go install command. This tool will help you convert SQL into type-safe Go code.
Verify installation with sqlc version.
Configure SQLC:

Create a sqlc.yaml configuration file in your project's root directory.
This informs SQLC where to find schema and query files and where to generate Go code.
Write SQL Queries:

In the sql/queries directory, you will create a users.sql file containing SQL queries.
For instance, you'll write a CreateUser query, using parameters that can be passed in from Go code.
Generate Go Code:

Run sqlc generate from the project root to generate Go bindings based on your SQL.
Ensure the Google uuid package is added to support unique identifiers.
Additional SQL Queries:

You'll also need to write a query to retrieve a user by name, using SQLC's query comment conventions.
Install PostgreSQL Driver:

Install and import a PostgreSQL driver to enable database connectivity in your Go application.
Manage Database Connection:

Utilize sql.Open() to establish a connection using the database URL.
Create a *database.Queries object from your generated package and store it in a state struct.
Create a Register Handler:

Implement functionality to add a new user, using methods generated by SQLC.
Handle scenarios such as duplicate names and store user info in a configuration.
Update Login Handler:

Handle errors for non-existent usernames during login attempts.
